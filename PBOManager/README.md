The files contained within this folder are for a program called PBO Manager.

PBO Manager is integral to the workflow of any Arma 3 modder, and as such should be one of the first things you install in preparation for modding Arma 3.


Only one of the files contained within this folder should be downloaded and installed, as they are for different architectures.

x64 is for 64-bit operating systems, while 6x86 is for 32-bit operating systems. If you are not sure what architecture of operating system you are running, do the following:

In your computer, open `Settings > System > About` and look for a field labelled as "Sytem Type". This field will say whether you are running an x64 or x86 system.


Upon installation, you may not notice anything different, but when you right-click on either a folder or PBO file, you will notice a new "PBO Manager" options box on your context menu. Please do not compress any old folder into a PBO, as there could possibly be unforseen consequences such as memory leakage upon trying to compress a file that was not intended to end up in a PBO. This could result in a crash or worse, and neither Bohemia Interactive nor Article 2 Studios are responsible for any damages caused.
