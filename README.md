# OPTRE_AuxMod_References
This repo is intended to be a place for members of the OPTRE community to acquire textures and information regarding retexturing OPTRE assets for use in unit mods.

Operation: TREBUCHET can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769440155&searchtext=operation+trebuchet

This repository is not guaranteed to be every single retexturable file in Operation: TREBUCHET, though all files contained within this repo *are* guaranteed to be of retexturable assets.

There will be some notes contained within directories of this repo to help end users locate config within the main branch of OPTRE, as to implement these textures effectively. Any questions that are not answered by any notes contained in this repo should be directed to the Article 2 Studios discord server: https://discord.gg/xaK2y32KSu

These filepaths may not directly represent the actual filepaths in any portion of the OPTRE mod, they are intended to be more human-legible and as such are formatted accordingly. Any instances where filepathing is different due to this will be noted in individual folder notes.
